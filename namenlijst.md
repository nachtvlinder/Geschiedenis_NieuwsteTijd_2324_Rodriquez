# Belangrijke Namen Geschiedenis van de Nieuwste Tijd


## Isala van Diest

Eerste vrouwelijke arts in België

Isala Van Diest (1842-1916) mag zichzelf de eerste vrouwelijke arts in België noemen. In 1879 behaalt ze haar doktersdiploma in het Zwitserse Bern, want in ons land mochten vrouwen nog geen academisch onderwijs volgen. Wanneer ze terugkeert naar België wordt haar diploma dan ook niet meteen erkend. Pas in 1884, nadat ze in het buitenland gewerkt heeft en extra examens heeft afgelegd in België, krijgt ze door een Koninklijk Besluit eindelijk toestemming om een praktijk te openen. Dat doet ze in 1886 in Brussel. In haar praktijk ontvangt ze voornamelijk vrouwelijke patiënten. Naast haar opvallende dokterscarrière, is Van Diest ook geëngageerd als sociaal en feministisch activist.


## Marie Popelin

Eerste vrouwelijke doctor in de Rechten in België en sleutelfiguur in de transnationale vrouwenbeweging tijdens de eerste feministische golf

In 1888 wordt Marie Popelin de eerste Belgische vrouw met een diploma en doctoraat in de Rechten. In theorie is er geen enkele Belgische wet die vrouwen de toegang tot de balie verbiedt, maar in de praktijk worden vrouwen belet het beroep van advocaat uit te oefenen. Verontwaardigd over deze genderdiscriminatie ijvert Marie de rest van haar leven voor gelijke rechten voor vrouwen, en vooral voor het recht van de vrouw om te studeren en eender welk beroep uit te oefenen. Popelin richt bovendien verschillende organisaties op, organiseert internationale congressen en wordt zo al gauw een sleutelfiguur in de transnationale samenwerkingen tijdens de eerste feministische golf.


## Zera Yacob

Zera Yacob (/ˈzɪərə jæˈkoʊb/; Ge'ez: ዘርዐ ያዕቆብ; 28 August 1599 – 1692) was an Ethiopian philosopher from the city of Aksum in the 17th century. His 1667 treatise, developed around 1630 and known in the original Ge'ez language as the Hatata (Inquiry), has been compared to René Descartes' Discours de la méthode (1637).

For centuries, Ge'ez texts had been written in Ethiopia. Around 1510, Abba Mikael translated and adapted the Arabic Book of the Wise Philosophers, a collection of sayings from the early Greek Pre-Socratics, Plato, and Aristotle via the neo-Platonic dialogues, also influenced by Arab philosophy and the Ethiopian discussions.[1]

Zera Yacob's Inquiry goes further than these former texts, as he argues in following one's natural reasoning instead of believing what one is told by others. He was a contemporary of the female activist Walatta Petros, whose biography was written in 1672.

Adam Smith, (baptized June 5, 1723, Kirkcaldy, Fife, Scotland—died July 17, 1790, Edinburgh) was a Scottish social philosopher and political economist, instrumental in the rise of classical liberalism.


## Adam Smith

Adam Smith is a towering figure in the history of economic thought. Known primarily for a single work—An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (1776), the first comprehensive system of political economy—he is more properly regarded as a social philosopher whose economic writings constitute only the capstone to an overarching view of political and social evolution. If his masterwork is viewed in relation to his earlier lectures on moral philosophy and government, as well as to allusions in The Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759) to a work he hoped to write on “the general principles of law and government, and of the different revolutions they have undergone in the different ages and periods of society,” then The Wealth of Nations may be seen not merely as a treatise on economics but also as a partial exposition of a much larger scheme of historical evolution.


## John Locke

John Locke, (born August 29, 1632, Wrington, Somerset, England—died October 28, 1704, High Laver, Essex) was an English philosopher whose works lie at the foundation of modern philosophical empiricism and political liberalism,classical liberalism in particular. He was an inspirer of both the European Enlightenment and the Constitution of the United States. His philosophical thinking was close to that of the founders of modern science, especially Robert Boyle, Sir Isaac Newton, and other members of the Royal Society. His political thought was grounded in the notion of a social contract between citizens and in the importance of toleration, especially in matters of religion. Much of what he advocated in the realm of politics was accepted in England after the Glorious Revolution of 1688–89 and in the United States after the country’s declaration of independence in 1776.


## Catharina de Grote

Catharina II Aleksejevna (Russisch: Екатерина II Алексеевна, Jekaterina II Aleksejevna; Stettin, 2 mei 1729 – Tsarskoje Selo, 17 november 1796), bijgenaamd Catharina de Grote (Russisch: Екатерина Великая, Jekaterina Velikaja), was van 1762 tot 1796 tsarina van Rusland.

Ze werd in het Duitse Stettin in Pommeren (sinds 1945 Szczecin in Polen) geboren als Sophia Augusta Frederika, prinses van Anhalt-Zerbst-Dornburg, dochter van vorst Christiaan August van Anhalt-Zerbst en hertogin Johanna Elisabeth van Sleeswijk-Holstein-Gottorp. Ze was een nicht van de koningen Gustaaf III en Karel XIII van Zweden en echtgenote van de Russische troonopvolger Peter III.

Gedurende bijna haar hele leven had Catharina zich voorbereid op regeren; ze las Machiavelli en voerde correspondentie met bekende filosofen uit het tijdperk van de Verlichting, zoals Voltaire en Diderot. Hoewel ze elkaar nooit ontmoet hebben, maakte Catharina met haar brieven een grote indruk op Voltaire en hij noemde haar De ster van het noorden en Semiramis van Rusland.

In 1767 liet Catharina haar Instructie, die gebaseerd was op het werk van Charles Montesquieu publiceren.[3] Zij liet dit door een wetgevende commissie beoordelen, waarin alle bevolkingsgroepen, behalve de lijfeigenen, waren vertegenwoordigd. Het bestuur werd gedecentraliseerd en er was sprake van een tendens naar deling van macht. Hiermee werd haar reputatie in het Westen gevestigd. Toch was de heerschappij van Catharina, die zich vanaf die tijd de Grote liet noemen, in de praktijk allerminst verlicht. Catharina gaf de adel volledige controle over hun lijfeigenen en landgoederen. Door gebiedsuitbreidingen in het zuiden, tijdens de Turks-Russische Oorlogen werden de oorspronkelijke heersers als adel aan het Russische hof opgenomen. De moslims uit het Krimkanaat verleende ze gelijke rechten en ze gaf aan de nieuwe edelen het recht om moskeeën te bouwen.

Catharina was geboeid door wetenschap en liet zich in 1768 inoculeren tegen de pokken door de Engelse arts Thomas Dimsdale. Ze zette zich in om deze praktijk te verspreiden aan haar hof en in haar rijk.


## Montesquieu

Montesquieu, in full Charles-Louis de Secondat, baron de La Brède et de Montesquieu,  (born January 18, 1689, Château La Brède, near Bordeaux, France—died February 10, 1755, Paris) was a French political philosopher whose principal work, The Spirit of Laws, was a major contribution to political theory.


## Voltaire

Voltaire, pseudonym of François-Marie Arouet, (born November 21, 1694, Paris, France—died May 30, 1778, Paris) was one of the greatest of all French writers. Although only a few of his works are still read, he continues to be held in worldwide repute as a courageous crusader against tyranny, bigotry, and cruelty. Through its critical capacity, wit, and satire, Voltaire’s work vigorously propagates an ideal of progress to which people of all nations have remained responsive. His long life spanned the last years of classicism and the eve of the revolutionary era, and during this age of transition his works and activities influenced the direction taken by European civilization.


## Rousseau

Jean-Jacques Rousseau, (born June 28, 1712, Geneva, Switzerland—died July 2, 1778, Ermenonville, France) was a Swiss-born philosopher, writer, and political theorist whose treatises and novels inspired the leaders of the French Revolution and the Romantic generation.

Rousseau was the least academic of modern philosophers and in many ways was the most influential. His thought marked the end of the European Enlightenment (the “Age of Reason”). He propelled political and ethical thinking into new channels. His reforms revolutionized taste, first in music, then in the other arts. He had a profound impact on people’s way of life; he taught parents to take a new interest in their children and to educate them differently; he furthered the expression of emotion rather than polite restraint in friendship and love. He introduced the cult of religious sentiment among people who had discarded religious dogma. He opened people’s eyes to the beauties of nature, and he made liberty an object of almost universal aspiration.


## Toussaint de l'Ouverture

Toussaint Louverture, Louverture also spelled L’Ouverture, original name (until c. 1793) François Dominique Toussaint,  (born c. 1743, Bréda, near Cap-Français, Saint-Domingue [Haiti]—died April 7, 1803, Fort-de-Joux, France) was the leader of the Haitian independence movement during the French Revolution (1787–99). He emancipated the enslaved people and negotiated for the French colony on Hispaniola, Saint-Domingue (later Haiti), to be governed, briefly, by formerly enslaved people as a French protectorate.


## Robespierre

Maximilien Robespierre, in full Maximilien-François-Marie-Isidore de Robespierre,  (born May 6, 1758, Arras, France—died July 28, 1794, Paris) was a radical Jacobin leader and one of the principal figures in the French Revolution. In the latter months of 1793, he came to dominate the Committee of Public Safety, the principal organ of the Revolutionary government during the Reign of Terror, but in 1794 he was overthrown and executed in the Thermidorian Reaction.


## Napoleon

Napoleon I, French in full Napoléon Bonaparte, original Italian Napoleone Buonaparte, byname the Corsicanor the Little Corporal, French byname Le Corseor Le Petit Caporal,  (born August 15, 1769, Ajaccio, Corsica—died May 5, 1821, St. Helena Island) was a French general, first consul (1799–1804), and emperor of the French (1804–1814/15), one of the most celebrated personages in the history of the West. He revolutionized military organization and training; sponsored the Napoleonic Code, the prototype of later civil-law codes; reorganized education; and established the long-lived Concordat with the papacy.

Napoleon’s many reforms left a lasting mark on the institutions of France and of much of western Europe. But his driving passion was the military expansion of French dominion, and, though at his fall he left France little larger than it had been at the outbreak of the Revolution in 1789, he was almost unanimously revered during his lifetime and until the end of the Second Empire under his nephew Napoleon III as one of history’s great heroes.


## Edmund Burke

Edmund Burke, (born January 12? [January 1, Old Style], 1729, Dublin, Ireland—died July 9, 1797, Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, England) was a British statesman, parliamentary orator, and political thinker prominent in public life from 1765 to about 1795 and important in the history of political theory. He championed conservatism in opposition to Jacobinism in Reflections on the Revolution in France (1790).


## Olympe de Gouges

Olympe de Gouges, also called Marie-Olympe de Gouges, original name Marie Gouze, married name Marie Aubry,  (born May 7, 1748, Montauban, France—died November 3, 1793, Paris) was a French social reformer and writer who challenged conventional views on a number of matters, especially the role of women as citizens. Many consider her among the world’s first feminists.

Marie was born to Anne Olympe Mouisset Gouze, who was married to Pierre Gouze, a butcher; Marie’s biological father may have been Jean-Jacques Lefranc (or Le Franc), marquis de Pompignan (see Researcher’s Note). Marie was married at age 16 and the mother of a son, but the marriage was short-lived. When her husband died, Marie changed her name to Olympe de Gouges, moved to Paris, and vowed never to marry again.

She became active in political causes and took up social issues that ranged from road improvement to divorce, maternity hospitals, abolitionism, and the rights of orphaned children and of unmarried mothers, and she wrote prolifically in defense of her ideas. Among her plays was L’Esclavage des noirs (“Slavery of Blacks”), which was staged at the Théâtre-Français. In 1791, as the French Revolution continued, she published the pamphlet Déclaration des droits de la femme et de la citoyenne (“Declaration of the Rights of Woman and of the [Female] Citizen”) as a reply to the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the [Male] Citizen (Déclaration des Droits de l’Homme et du Citoyen), which had been adopted two years earlier by the National Assembly. In the pamphlet she asserted not only that women have the same rights as men but also that children born outside of marriage should be treated as fairly as “legitimate” children in matters of inheritance.

De Gouges sided with the moderate Girondins against the Montagnards, defended Louis XVI, and called for a plebiscite to allow citizens to choose their form of government. After the fall of the Girondins in the summer of 1793, she was arrested and was subjected to a mock trial, and on November 3 she was sent to the guillotine.


## Mary Wollstonecraft

Mary Wollstonecraft, married name Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin,  (born April 27, 1759, London, England—died September 10, 1797, London) was an English writer and passionate advocate of educational and social equality for women. She outlined her beliefs in A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), considered a classic of feminism.


## Manuela Sáenz

Manuela Sáenz de Vergara y Aizpuru (Quito, Viceroyalty of New Granada, 27 December 1797 – Peru, 23 November 1856) was an Ecuadorian revolutionary heroine of South America who supported the revolutionary cause by gathering information, distributing leaflets and protesting for women's rights. Manuela received the Order of the Sun ("Caballeresa del Sol" or 'Dame of the Sun'), honoring her services in the revolution.

Sáenz married a wealthy English doctor in 1817 and became a socialite in Lima, Peru. This provided the setting for involvement in political and military affairs, and she became active in support of revolutionary efforts. Leaving her husband in 1822, she soon began an eight-year collaboration and intimate relationship with Simón Bolívar that lasted until his death in 1830. After she prevented an 1828 assassination attempt against him and facilitated his escape, Bolívar began to call her "Libertadora del libertador" ("liberator of the liberator"). In an unknown letter she wrote, she claimed that "the Liberator is immortal," despite the fact that she was responsible for his survival.[1] Manuela's role in the revolution after her death was generally overlooked until the late twentieth century, but now she is recognized as a feminist symbol of the 19th century wars of independence.


## Isabelle Gatti de Gamond

Isabelle Gatti de Gamond (Parijs, 28 juli 1839 - 11 oktober 1905) was een Belgische feministe en stichtte middelbare scholen voor meisjes.

Zij was een van de eerste vrouwen die zich verzette tegen de idee van de femmes savantes. Dit waren geëmancipeerde vrouwen die door te studeren hun vrouwelijkheid verloren hadden. Gatti de Gamond zag het onderwijs zelfs als een belangrijk wapen in de strijd voor gelijke rechten. Onder invloed van de pedagogische geschriften van haar moeder, Zoë de Gamond, start ze het tijdschrift Cahier de Femmes. Hierin schrijft ze over haar ideeën. Enkele jaren later in 1864 richt ze met steun van het Brussels stadsbestuur een (Franstalige) middelbare meisjesschool op. De leraren zijn stuk voor stuk vrijzinnigen en de leerstof is voor die tijd zeer vooruitstrevend. Het motiverend ideaal is om 'niet een vrouw te creëren zoals door ijlkoorts bevangen koorknapen in hun wilde fantasieën dromen' maar een geëmancipeerde vrouw, respectabel door haar werk, talent en kennis. De school slaat meteen aan bij de liberale burgerij. Daarop aansluitend heeft Isabelle Gatti in tien jaar tijd achttien dergelijke scholen opgericht. De "Cours d'Education" vormt een inspiratiebron voor de latere feministische inzet die gedragen wordt door een netwerk van afgestudeerden, de gatticiennes. Marie Popelin, eerste vrouwelijke juriste ooit, was een van hen. Ook de eerste vrouw in het parlement, Marie Spaak-Janson was een gatticienne, net als politica Louise Coens, schrijfster Marguerite Van de Wiele, publiciste Elise Soyer, pedagoge Augustine De Rothmaler en filosofe Louise Van Duuren.


## Emilie Claeys

Emelia Maria (Emilie) Claeys (Gent, 9 mei 1855 - aldaar, 16 februari 1943) was een Belgisch socialistisch vrouwenrechtenactiviste.

Claeys werd in 1886 voorzitster van de Socialistische Propagandaclub voor vrouwen, onderdeel van de Belgische Werkliedenpartij (BWP). Door de tussenkomst van de vrouwenclub nam de partij in 1893 het stemrecht voor vrouwen op in haar programma (maar het werd later herzien, en uiteindelijk in België pas gerealiseerd in 1948). Naast vrouwenstemrecht maakte Claeys zich ook sterk voor gelijke arbeid voor vrouwen zodat zij financieel onafhankelijk zouden kunnen zijn. Vrouwen moesten zich bevrijden van kapitalistische uitbuiting én van onderdrukking door hun echtgenoten. Van 1892 tot 1896 zat Claeys in de raad van bestuur van de Gentse Bond Moyson en ondertussen gaf ze diverse brochures over vrouwenrechten uit. In 1893 werd Claeys verkozen tot de Landelijke Raad van de BWP en vertegenwoordigde ze Vlaanderen op het Internationaal Socialistische Arbeiderscongres in Zurich. In datzelfde jaar werd ze uitgever van de socialistische krant Vooruit (1884–1991) en richtte Claeys samen met Nellie van Kol de Hollandsch-Vlaamsche Vrouwenbond op, met het bijbehorende maandblad De Vrouw. Claeys en Van Kol hielden zich naast gelijke rechten en kansen voor vrouwen ook bezig met geboortebeperking en voorbehoedsmiddelen, waardoor De Vrouw in België op de katholieke index van verboden lectuur terechtkwam. Haar stukken over geboortebeperking ondertekende ze met de naam 'Lilian'. Niet alleen de kerk, maar ook andere leden van de BWP waren het oneens met geboortebeperking.


## Klemens von Metternich

Klemens von Metternich, in full Klemens Wenzel Nepomuk Lothar, Fürst von Metternich-Winneburg-Beilstein,  (born May 15, 1773, Coblenz, Archbishopric of Trier [Germany]—died June 11, 1859, Vienna, Austria) was an Austrian statesman, minister of foreign affairs (1809–48), and a champion of conservatism, who helped form the victorious alliance against Napoleon I and who restored Austria as a leading European power, hosting the Congress of Vienna in 1814–15.


## Leopold I

Leopold I, French in full Léopold-Georges-Chrétien-Frédéric, Dutch in full Leopold George Christiaan Frederik,  (born December 16, 1790, Coburg, Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld [Germany]—died December 10, 1865, Laeken, Belgium) was the first king of the Belgians (1831–65), who helped strengthen the nation’s new parliamentary system and, as a leading figure in European diplomacy, scrupulously maintained Belgian neutrality.


## Florence Nightingale

Florence Nightingale, byname Lady with the Lamp,  (born May 12, 1820, Florence [Italy]—died August 13, 1910, London, England) was a British nurse, statistician, and social reformer who was the foundational philosopher of modern nursing. Nightingale was put in charge of nursing British and allied soldiers in Turkey during the Crimean War. She spent many hours in the wards, and her night rounds giving personal care to the wounded established her image as the “Lady with the Lamp.” Her efforts to formalize nursing education led her to establish the first scientifically based nursing school—the Nightingale School of Nursing, at St. Thomas’ Hospital in London (opened 1860). She also was instrumental in setting up training for midwives and nurses in workhouse infirmaries. She was the first woman awarded the Order of Merit (1907). International Nurses Day, observed annually on May 12, commemorates her birth and celebrates the important role of nurses in health care.


## Karl Marx

Karl Marx, in full Karl Heinrich Marx,  (born May 5, 1818, Trier, Rhine province, Prussia [Germany]—died March 14, 1883, London, England) was a revolutionary, sociologist, historian, and economist. He published (with Friedrich Engels) Manifest der Kommunistischen Partei (1848), commonly known as The Communist Manifesto, the most celebrated pamphlet in the history of the socialist movement. He also was the author of the movement’s most important book, Das Kapital. These writings and others by Marx and Engels form the basis of the body of thought and belief known as Marxism. (See also socialism; communism.)


## Edouard Bernstein

Eduard Bernstein, (born Jan. 6, 1850, Berlin—died Dec. 18, 1932, Berlin) was a Social Democratic propagandist, political theorist, and historian, one of the first Socialists to attempt a revision of Karl Marx’s tenets, such as abandoning the ideas of the imminent collapse of the capitalist economy and the seizure of power by the proletariat. Although he was not a distinguished theoretician, Bernstein, called “the father of revisionism,” envisaged a type of social democracy that combined private initiative with social reform.


## Leo XIII

Leo XIII, original name Vincenzo Gioacchino Pecci,  (born March 2, 1810, Carpineto Romano, Papal States—died July 20, 1903, Rome) was the head of the Roman Catholic Church (1878–1903) who brought a new spirit to the papacy, expressed in more conciliatory positions toward civil governments, by less opposition to scientific progress, and by an awareness of the pastoral and social needs of the times.


## Otto von Bismarck

Otto von Bismarck, in full Otto Eduard Leopold, Fürst (prince) von Bismarck, Graf (count) von Bismarck-Schönhausen, Herzog (duke) von Lauenburg,  (born April 1, 1815, Schönhausen, Altmark, Prussia [Germany]—died July 30, 1898, Friedrichsruh, near Hamburg) was the prime minister of Prussia (1862–73, 1873–90) and founder and first chancellor (1871–90) of the German Empire. Once the empire was established, he actively and skillfully pursued pacific policies in foreign affairs, succeeding in preserving the peace in Europe for about two decades. But in domestic policies his patrimony was less benign, for he failed to rise above the authoritarian proclivities of the landed squirearchy to which he was born.


## Vladimir Lenin

Vladimir Lenin, also called Vladimir Ilich Lenin, original name Vladimir Ilich Ulyanov,  (born April 10 [April 22, New Style], 1870, Simbirsk, Russia—died January 21, 1924, Gorki [later Gorki Leninskiye], near Moscow) was the founder of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), inspirer and leader of the Bolshevik Revolution (1917), and the architect, builder, and first head (1917–24) of the Soviet state. He was the founder of the organization known as Comintern (Communist International) and the posthumous source of “Leninism,” the doctrine codified and conjoined with Karl Marx’s works by Lenin’s successors to form Marxism-Leninism, which became the Communist worldview.


## Leon Trotsky (vrije additie)

Leon Trotsky, byname of Lev Davidovich Bronshtein,  (born November 7 [October 26, Old Style], 1879, Yanovka, Ukraine, Russian Empire—died August 21, 1940, Coyoacán, Mexico) was a communist theorist and agitator, a leader in Russia’s October Revolution in 1917, and later commissar of foreign affairs and of war in the Soviet Union (1917–24). In the struggle for power following Vladimir Ilich Lenin’s death, however, Joseph Stalin emerged as victor, while Trotsky was removed from all positions of power and later exiled (1929). He remained the leader of an anti-Stalinist opposition abroad until his assassination by a Stalinist agent.


## Woodrow Wilson

Woodrow Wilson, in full Thomas Woodrow Wilson,  (born December 28, 1856, Staunton, Virginia, U.S.—died February 3, 1924, Washington, D.C.) was the 28th president of the United States (1913–21), an American scholar and statesman best remembered for his legislative accomplishments and his high-minded idealism. Wilson led his country into World War I and became the creator and leading advocate of the League of Nations, for which he was awarded the 1919 Nobel Prize for Peace. During his second term the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, giving women the right to vote, was passed and ratified. He suffered a paralytic stroke while seeking American public support for the Treaty of Versailles (October 1919), and his incapacity, which lasted for the rest of his term of office, caused the worst crisis of presidential disability in American history.


## Kemal Atatürk

Kemal Atatürk, (Turkish: “Kemal, Father of Turks”) original name Mustafa Kemal,also called Mustafa Kemal Paşa,  (born 1881, Salonika [now Thessaloníki], Greece—died November 10, 1938, Istanbul, Turkey) was a soldier, statesman, and reformer who was the founder and first president (1923–38) of the Republic of Turkey. He modernized the country’s legal and educational systems and encouraged the adoption of a European way of life, with Turkish written in the Latin alphabet and with citizens adopting European-style names.

One of the great figures of the 20th century, Atatürk rescued the surviving Turkish remnant of the defeated Ottoman Empire at the end of World War I. He galvanized his people against invading Greek forces who sought to impose the Allied will upon the war-weary Turks and repulsed aggression by British, French, and Italian troops. Through these struggles, he founded the modern Republic of Turkey, for which he is still revered by the Turks. He succeeded in restoring to his people pride in their Turkishness, coupled with a new sense of accomplishment as their nation was brought into the modern world. Over the next two decades, Atatürk created a modern state that would grow under his successors into a viable democracy. (For a more complete discussion of this period in Turkish history, see Turkey, history of: The emergence of the modern Turkish state.)


## Benito Mussolini

Benito Mussolini, in full Benito Amilcare Andrea Mussolini, byname Il Duce (Italian: “The Leader”),  (born July 29, 1883, Predappio, Italy—died April 28, 1945, near Dongo) was the Italian prime minister (1922–43) and the first of 20th-century Europe’s fascist dictators.


## Mao Zedong (also written as: Mao Tse Tung)

Mao Zedong, Wade-Giles romanization Mao Tse-tung,  (born December 26, 1893, Shaoshan, Hunan province, China—died September 9, 1976, Beijing) was the principal Chinese Marxist theorist, soldier, and statesman who led his country’s communist revolution. Mao was the leader of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) from 1935 until his death, and he was chairman (chief of state) of the People’s Republic of China from 1949 to 1959 and chairman of the party also until his death.

When China emerged from a half century of revolution as the world’s most populous country and launched itself on a path of economic development and social change, Mao Zedong occupied a critical place in the story of the country’s resurgence. To be sure, he did not play a dominant role throughout the whole struggle. In the early years of the CCP, he was a secondary figure, though by no means a negligible one, and even after the 1940s (except perhaps during the Cultural Revolution) the crucial decisions were not his alone. Nevertheless, looking at the whole period from the foundation of the CCP in 1921 to Mao’s death in 1976, one can fairly regard Mao Zedong as the principal architect of the new China.


## Jozef (NL, ENG: Joseph) Stalin

Joseph Stalin, Russian in full Iosif Vissarionovich Stalin, original name (Georgian) Ioseb Dzhugashvili,  (born December 18 [December 6, Old Style], 1878, Gori, Georgia, Russian Empire [see Researcher’s Note] —died March 5, 1953, Moscow, Russia, U.S.S.R.) was the secretary-general of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (1922–53) and premier of the Soviet state (1941–53), who for a quarter of a century dictatorially ruled the Soviet Union and transformed it into a major world power.

During the quarter of a century preceding his death, the Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin probably exercised greater political power than any other figure in history. Stalin industrialized the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, forcibly collectivized its agriculture, consolidated his position by intensive police terror, helped to defeat Germany in 1941–45, and extended Soviet controls to include a belt of eastern European states. Chief architect of Soviet totalitarianism and a skilled but phenomenally ruthless organizer, he destroyed the remnants of individual freedom and failed to promote individual prosperity, yet he created a mighty military-industrial complex and led the Soviet Union into the nuclear age.

Stalin’s biography was long obscured by a mendacious Soviet-propagated “legend” exaggerating his prowess as a heroic Bolshevik boy-conspirator and faithful follower of Lenin, the founder of the Soviet Union. In his prime, Stalin was hailed as a universal genius, as a “shining sun,” or “the staff of life,” and also as a “great teacher and friend” (especially of those communities he most savagely persecuted); once he was even publicly invoked as “Our Father” by a metropolitan of the Russian Orthodox Church. Achieving wide visual promotion through busts, statues, and icons of himself, the dictator became the object of a fanatical cult that, in private, he probably regarded with cynicism.


## Adolf Hitler

Adolf Hitler, byname Der Führer (German: “The Leader”),  (born April 20, 1889, Braunau am Inn, Austria—died April 30, 1945, Berlin, Germany) was the leader of the Nazi Party (from 1920/21) and chancellor (Kanzler) and Führer of Germany (1933–45). His worldview revolved around two concepts: territorial expansion and racial supremacy. Those themes informed his decision to invade Poland, which marked the start of World War II, as well as the systematic killing of six million Jews and millions of others during the Holocaust.

Hitler’s father, Alois (born 1837), was illegitimate. For a time he bore his mother’s name, Schicklgruber, but by 1876 he had established his family claim to the surname Hitler. Adolf never used any other surname.


## Franklin D. Roosevelt

Franklin D. Roosevelt, in full Franklin Delano Roosevelt, byname FDR,  (born January 30, 1882, Hyde Park, New York, U.S.—died April 12, 1945, Warm Springs, Georgia) was the 32nd president of the United States (1933–45). The only president elected to the office four times, Roosevelt led the United States through two of the greatest crises of the 20th century: the Great Depression and World War II. In so doing, he greatly expanded the powers of the federal government through a series of programs and reforms known as the New Deal, and he served as the principal architect of the successful effort to rid the world of German National Socialism and Japanese militarism.


## Winston Churchill

Winston Churchill, in full Sir Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill,  (born November 30, 1874, Blenheim Palace, Oxfordshire, England—died January 24, 1965, London) was a British statesman, orator, and author who as prime minister (1940–45, 1951–55) rallied the British people during World War II and led his country from the brink of defeat to victory.


## Josip Broz Tito

Josip Broz Tito, original name Josip Broz,  (born May 7, 1892, Kumrovec, near Zagreb, Croatia, Austria-Hungary [now in Croatia]—died May 4, 1980, Ljubljana, Yugoslavia [now in Slovenia]) was a Yugoslav revolutionary and statesman. He was secretary-general (later president) of the Communist Party (League of Communists) of Yugoslavia (1939–80), supreme commander of the Yugoslav Partisans (1941–45) and the Yugoslav People’s Army (1945–80), and marshal (1943–80), premier (1945–53), and president (1953–80) of Yugoslavia. Tito was the chief architect of the “second Yugoslavia,” a socialist federation that lasted from World War II until 1991.

## John Maynard Keynes

John Maynard Keynes, (born June 5, 1883, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, England—died April 21, 1946, Firle, Sussex) was an English economist, journalist, and financier best known for his economic theories (Keynesian economics) on the causes of prolonged unemployment. His most important work, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (1935–36), advocated a remedy for economic recession based on a government-sponsored policy of full employment.


## Mahatma Gandhi

Mahatma Gandhi, byname of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi,  (born October 2, 1869, Porbandar, India—died January 30, 1948, Delhi) was an Indian lawyer, politician, social activist, and writer who became the leader of the nationalist movement against the British rule of India. As such, he came to be considered the father of his country. Gandhi is internationally esteemed for his doctrine of nonviolent protest (satyagraha) to achieve political and social progress.

In the eyes of millions of his fellow Indians, Gandhi was the Mahatma (“Great Soul”). The unthinking adoration of the huge crowds that gathered to see him all along the route of his tours made them a severe ordeal; he could hardly work during the day or rest at night. “The woes of the Mahatmas,” he wrote, “are known only to the Mahatmas.” His fame spread worldwide during his lifetime and only increased after his death. The name Mahatma Gandhi is now one of the most universally recognized on earth.

He held the title of premier until 1976 and then began a long tenure as president of the Council of State and the Council of Ministers. He handed over provisional power in July 2006 because of health problems and formally relinquished the presidency in February 2008.


## Ernesto 'Che' Guevara

## Simone de Beauvoir

Simone de Beauvoir, in full Simone-Lucie-Ernestine-Marie Bertrand de Beauvoir,  (born January 9, 1908, Paris, France—died April 14, 1986, Paris) was a French writer and feminist, a member of the intellectual fellowship of philosopher-writers who have given a literary transcription to the themes of existentialism. She is known primarily for her treatise Le Deuxième Sexe, 2 vol. (1949; The Second Sex), a scholarly and passionate plea for the abolition of what she called the myth of the “eternal feminine.” It became a classic of feminist literature.

Schooled in private institutions, Beauvoir attended the Sorbonne, where in 1929 she passed her agrégation in philosophy and met Jean-Paul Sartre, beginning a lifelong association with him. She taught at a number of schools (1931–43) before turning to writing for her livelihood. In 1945 she and Sartre founded and began editing Le Temps modernes, a monthly review.


## Betty Friedan

Betty Friedan, née Bettye Naomi Goldstein,  (born February 4, 1921, Peoria, Illinois, U.S.—died February 4, 2006, Washington, D.C.) was an American feminist best known for her book The Feminine Mystique (1963), which explores the causes of the frustrations of modern women in traditional roles.

Bettye Goldstein graduated in 1942 from Smith College with a degree in psychology and, after a year of graduate work at the University of California, Berkeley, settled in New York City. She worked at various jobs until 1947, when she married Carl Friedan (divorced 1969). For 10 years thereafter she lived as a housewife and mother in the suburbs of New York while doing freelance work for a number of magazines. In 1957 a questionnaire that she circulated among her Smith classmates suggested to her that a great many of them were, like her, deeply dissatisfied with their lives. She planned and undertook an extensive series of studies on the topic—formulating more detailed questionnaires, conducting interviews, discussing her results with psychologists and other students of behaviour—and finally organized her findings, illuminated by her personal experiences, in her 1963 landmark book, The Feminine Mystique.

Claudette Colvin, born Claudette Austin,  (born September 5, 1939, Birmingham, Alabama, U.S.) is an American woman who was arrested as a teenager in 1955 for refusing to give up her bus seat to a white woman. Her protest was one of several by Black women challenging segregation on buses in the months before Rosa Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat. Parks’s action, however, is more well known, having precipitated the 1955–56 Montgomery bus boycott in Alabama that helped spark the American civil rights movement.

The only British prime minister in the 20th century to win three consecutive terms and, at the time of her resignation, Britain’s longest continuously serving prime minister since 1827, she accelerated the evolution of the British economy from statism to liberalism and became, by personality as much as achievement, the most renowned British political leader since Winston Churchill. She was a role model for a later prime minister, Liz Truss.


## Ronald Reagan

Ronald Reagan, in full Ronald Wilson Reagan,  (born February 6, 1911, Tampico, Illinois, U.S.—died June 5, 2004, Los Angeles, California) was the 40th president of the United States (1981–89), noted for his conservative Republicanism, his fervent anticommunism, and his appealing personal style, characterized by a jaunty affability and folksy charm. The only movie actor ever to become president, he had a remarkable skill as an orator that earned him the title “the Great Communicator.” His policies have been credited with contributing to the demise of Soviet communism.


## Paus Johannes Paulus II - Karol Józef Wojtyła

(His predecessor was Johannes Paulus I, with the shortest ever pontificate of 33 days, and the first with a pastoral background since Pius X; otoh this guy - JP II - was the first non-Italian pope in 455 years AND he had the third longest pontificate in history; speaking of contrast...)

St. John Paul II, Latin Johannes Paulus, original name Karol Józef Wojtyła,  (born May 18, 1920, Wadowice, Poland—died April 2, 2005, Vatican City; beatified May 1, 2011; canonized April 27, 2014; feast day October 22) was the bishop of Rome and head of the Roman Catholic Church from 1978 to 2005. He was the first non-Italian pope in 455 years and the first from a Slavic country. His pontificate of more than 26 years was the third longest in history. As part of his effort to promote greater understanding between nations and between religions, he undertook numerous trips abroad, traveling far greater distances than had all other popes combined, and he extended his influence beyond the church by campaigning against political oppression and criticizing the materialism of the West. He also issued several unprecedented apologies to groups that historically had been wronged by Catholics, most notably Jews and Muslims. His unabashed Polish nationalism and his emphasis on nonviolent political activism aided the Solidarity movement in communist Poland in the 1980s and ultimately contributed to the peaceful dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. More generally, John Paul used his influence among Catholics and throughout the world to advance the recognition of human dignity and to deter the use of violence. His centralized style of church governance, however, dismayed some members of the clergy, who found it autocratic and stifling. He failed to reverse an overall decline in the numbers of priests and nuns, and his traditional interpretations of church teachings on personal and sexual morality alienated some segments of the laity.

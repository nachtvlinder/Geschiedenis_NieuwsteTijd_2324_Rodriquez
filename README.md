# University Course Summary: Geschiedenis van de Nieuwste Tijd

This repository contains my markwhen, markmap and other digital resources that I created myself or found online and wanted to keep together with my overviews and summaries in the learning process for a KUL
university course on modern history, as taught in the academic year 2023-24 second semester. As I was using VS Codium to create my mindmaps
and timelines, I decided to keep them synced over GitHub so I could potentially access my notes on a different machine if needed, and to keep the 
future opportunity of sharing my timeline, mindmap or some notes with fellow students.

If you want to edit the material for your own use, you can fork this repo or request the particular file you need. Or just copy and paste. 

Insofar as I were to hold any rights over it, which I don't think since it is all based on professor
Rodriguez' course content and some online research here and there (mainly Britannica and Wikipedia, sources otherwise mentioned inline)
, I would only allow free use for study and non-profit purposes.

_IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: I think it's best to consider my notes, timelines and overviews as very incomplete. Remember also that it was
created from one person's perspective and learning process. Always refer to official course materials for correct and complete information and content._

# University Course Summary: Geschiedenis van de Nieuwste Tijd

This repository contains my markwhen, markmap and other digital resources that I created myself in the learning process for a KUL
university course on modern history, as taught in the academic year 2023-24 second semester. As I was using VS Codium to create my mindmaps
and timelines, I decided to keep them synced over github so I could potentially acces my notes on a different machine if needed, and to keep the 
future opportunity of sharing my timeline, mindmap or some notes with fellow students.
